HAUS - the Home AUtomation System

================================================================================
About HAUS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The goal of the HAUS project is to provide a means to connect every home device
to a HAUS server, which can be used to automate tasks or provide remote control
capabilities to users.

HAUS is designed with two parts:
    o A single, front-facing HAUS Server, which is responsible for providing a
      user interface.
    o One or more HAUS Devices, which listen for commands from the HAUS Server
      and respond by performing a home automation task.

Package Contents
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
At the top level, along with the READY and COPYING files, you should see
directories for Servers and Devices.

Under the Servers directory, you'll see a list of technologies for which a HAUS
Server has been developed.

Under the Deveices directory, you'll see a list of hardware platforms for which
HAUS Devices have been developed.

Your package contents may look something like this:
    ~/COPYING
    ~/README
    ~/Devices/
        Netduino/
            Lights/
            Sprinklers/
